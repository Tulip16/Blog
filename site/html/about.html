		<p>This page is an effort by me to express my opinions<br> by weaving them into poems or compiling them<br> into articles.Myriad Musings, reflective of it's name,<br> is a collection of varied pieces, all of which rise<br> from the common desire to pour out my feelings onto<br> an empty canvas in order to adorn it with the jewels of words.<br> I hope to be able to provide the readers with<br> quality material from all walks of life. An avid reader<br>passionate about the rhythms of the soul expressed through<br> music and dance, I am currently pursuing a degree<br> in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Bombay.
