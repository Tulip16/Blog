E yes fixed on the sieve she held;<br>
A gain, she heard the call for chai.<br>
T hrough the mesh, she saw the light; <br>
H er hands held a star-filled sky.<br><br>

O oblivious of reality,she'd let her dreams fly free. <br>
F finally the flight did end,<br><br>

A s soon as she poured the tea.<br><br>

D darkness replaced the light,<br>
R ealisation replaced the hope. <br>
E very star that pleased her sight, <br>
A kin to her life, was burdened with load. <br>
M elancholy, she dropped the cup, alongwith it the creamer.<br>
E very dream of hers was crushed to bits.<br>
R ise of a realist began, so did the death of a dreamer.<br>
