		<p>When through the sweet confines of a haven, you see,<br>
The world looks so full of meaning.<br>
Merry faces ;Hearts  full of glee ;<br>
Accusing them would seem demeaning. <br><br>

It doesn't  seem like a believable truth,<br> 
For of course you step on the Roses first .<br>
What awaits you is the lack of ruth ,<br>
Crush the thorns next or you get crushed .<br><br>

Crush them and you feel the pain ,<br>
So you're ready to get crushed instead ;<br>
But isn't it all the same ?<br>
For you step on them and on your soul they tread .<br><br>

And then there is that sigh of relief ,<br>
For you look around and see lovely smiles .<br>
In a utopia ,they strengthen your belief ,<br>
With a promise of lasting a thousand miles.<br><br>

You crave to give in to temptation, <br>
And of course you can't resist .<br>
For friendship you build the foundation <br> 
But the pane of trust is now covered with mist .<br><br>

And no plain mist it is,<br>
For it so terribly hurts your eyes ;<br>
Tears clearing the mist of fake bliss,<br>
Finally making you realize .</p>
