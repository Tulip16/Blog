		<p>They stared in awe at the sparkling sea, <br>
Which ,in varying shades, the light did paint. <br>
They heard different types of sounds; <br>
The chirping -clear;the sobbing- faint. <br><br>

They were all jealous of the girl; <br>
The sole soul in the splendid sea. <br>
In the waves who got to roll and swirl, <br>
They didn't know what for her it'd be. <br><br>

They knew; the one who had the right, <br>
To bask in the glorious sea;<br>
Was the one who could muster the might<br> 
To fight the waves with bravery.<br><br>

They thought that she was bold and brave , <br>
Worthy of all the pleasures she had. <br>
Little did they really know , <br>
She was anything but glad. <br>

They wondered if there was a ship, <br>
That in this ocean did not sail. <br>
Only one called friendship did she know, <br>
In every attempt,it only did fail. <br><br>

They say small things are magical, <br> 
And she couldn't agree more. <br>
This sea was indeed made of drops; <br>
That flowed from her eyes when times were sore. <br><br>

For she was the creator of the sea, <br>
She wouldn't drown even in a faulty boat. <br>
For it reminded her of sorrows and pains, <br>
She didn't wish to stay afloat. <br><br>

She wished to swim with deadly pace, <br>
And reach the shore where she could see. <br>
Perhaps a smiling friendly face, <br> 
Who knew what she was and could be. <br>
