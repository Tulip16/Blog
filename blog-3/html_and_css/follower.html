		<p>I walked through black; <br>
Dark, vacant and lifeless. <br>
In search of an opening,<br>
I walked deeper into the mess .<br><br>

A branch tore my skin.<br>
I tripped over a stone.<br>
I followed a thousand steps,<br>
But only alone.<br><br>


“The path must lead to light”, I assured myself;<br>
“It is followed by everyone”.<br>
I sensed a thousand openings,<br>
But ventured into none.<br><br>

Everyday a little closer,<br>
To the illusionary light.<br>
Everyday a little farther from,<br>
The escape hidden in sight.<br><br>

And every now and then<br>
An inquisitive mole,<br>
Tired and hopeless,<br>
Jumped out of a hole.<br><br>

And there were those <br>
Whose faith had seen an end. <br>
Who accepted the darkness, <br>
And stopped to pretend. <br><br>

You could find a soul like this<br>
On every other turn;<br>
Who united with the light of death,<br>
When its body was left to burn.<br><br>

I reminded myself everyday, <br>
Of the light I would see. <br>
Little by little, I embraced the dark;<br>
My only company.<br><br>

But one day I felt a blinding light, <br>
One I could almost see. <br>
 I peered out of the hole <br>
And though if I should flee. <br><br>

Everyone had dismissed it <br>
As any other hole. <br>
Why then it had thrust, <br>
Its impression on my soul? <br><br>

Keeping aside my doubts, <br>
I followed my heart’s call. <br>
Light or no-light, <br>
It would end once and for all. <br><br>

Ahead of me the merriest world, <br>
And on my side there lay; <br>
A cloth loosened  by the fall, <br>
The blindfold I had all the way. <br><br>
